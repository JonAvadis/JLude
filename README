This is a little but very powerful javascript 'library'. It offers
various and mighty functions which allow you to formulate powerful
and short expressions. These functions are commonly used in
functional languages.

All functions support currying. This is done by checking arguments
for undefined, as if a function parameter is not specified in a
call it is undefined.


EXAMPLES
********

Find the first number 2^n greater than 100.
  until(flip(gt,100),mul(2),1)
 => 128

Add 1 to each element in a list.
  map(add(1),[1,2,3])
 => [2,3,4]

Apply several functions to the same value.
  map($a(5),[add(3),mul(3),sub(3),div(3)])
 => 8,15,-2,0.6

Compose functions.
  $cm([foldl1(sub),reverse])([1,2,3,4])
 => -2
